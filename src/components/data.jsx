    overview: `MyChai is a full-stack eCommerce platform for premium loose-leaf tea and teaware. It features a responsive UI, a cart system with Firebase integration, Stripe payments, and a light/dark mode toggle for a personalized user experience. The backend, built with Node.js and Railway, manages payments and order processing securely.
    
    My target audience was tea enthusiasts looking for a curated shopping experience.
    This influenced design decisions, UI choices, and the color palette, ensuring an elegant and minimal aesthetic.`,
