    title: 'MyChai â€“ Premium Loose Leaf Tea eCommerce Store',
    subtitle: 'Full-Stack eCommerce with Stripe Payments & Firebase',
    overview: `MyChai is a concept eCommerce store designed for premium loose-leaf teas and teaware. The goal was to build a fully functional, responsive eCommerce platform with core features like a cart system, product sorting, user accounts, and Stripe payments.

    Additionally, I wanted to learn Node.js backend fundamentals and integrate a Railway-hosted API for secure payments.
    
    My target audience was tea enthusiasts looking for a curated shopping experience.
    This influenced design decisions, UI choices, and the color palette, ensuring an elegant and minimal aesthetic.`,

        title: "Stripe Payment Integration & Backend Hosting",
        problem:
          "Stripe was straightforward on localhost, but when deploying, the integration broke due to CORS errors and missing image paths. Initially, I ran the backend locally (localhost:4000), but when moving to production, I had 502 errors on Railway, even though logs and variables seemed correct.",
        solution: [
          "Hosted `server.js` separately in a new GitHub repository.",
          "Used Railway to deploy the backend, fixing the PORT mismatch (should be 8080, not 4000).",
          "Solved CORS issues by allowing multiple frontend origins: `['https://ljames97.github.io', 'https://ljames97.github.io/my-chai']`.",
          "Adjusted image paths so Stripe could fetch them correctly on the checkout page.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Firebase Authentication & Cart Management",
        problem:
          "Managing cart state across guest users and authenticated users was tricky. Firebase rules needed to be adjusted to allow secure cart modifications.",
        solution: [
          "Used LocalStorage for guest users and Firebase for authenticated users.",
          "Applied React Context API to avoid prop drilling and ensure cart state was globally accessible.",
          "Implemented Firebase authentication rules for secure account creation, order tracking, and profile photo updates.",

    finalThoughts: 'This project deepened my understanding of full-stack development, from frontend UI/UX to backend deployment and authentication. The most challenging part was debugging deployment issues with Railway, Stripe, and CORS, but those challenges reinforced problem-solving skills that are critical for real-world projects.',
